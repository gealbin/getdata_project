This analysis reads data from the proyect's data set Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones, the dataset can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. See README.txt for more info about the project.
The script run_analysis.R get two data sets called tidy_data_1 and tidy_data_2. The script assumes that the data files from the project are located in the working directory.
The first tidy data set combines the training and test information and the activities and subjects. It only shows the average and std features.
It is basically a data frame with columns: subject, activity label and the features mentioned. Each row represent a different test for a given subject and activity
To get the original list of features, refer to features.txt. The features are explained in features_info.txt.

The second tidy data set splits the first tidy data set into subject and activity, and calculates the average for each feature of the first tidy data set.
That is represented as a data frame where the columns are the features and the raws are the combination of subject and activity eg: 13.WALKING.
